### TL;DR

## Permissions

I'm cool with anyone using the code or parts of the code for their site. However, if you are using the largely unmodified site design, I would appreciate being credited as the website designer.

I do not give permission to present any of my projects as your own (this is being actively used as my portfolio site and these are my real projects I've worked on).
